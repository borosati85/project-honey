# Honey Webshop

## Description
This is a small webshop I made for practice, while learning React. I was talking with a friend of mine, who is beekeeper as a hobby, and he was thinking about selling honey on the web, which gave me the idea to make a small webshop for him, altough this is just a practice project yet.

In this application I used the following technologies:
- React
- React Router
- Redux (Saga, Persist, Reselect, Logger)
- Styled Components
- Stripe
- Firebase (authentication, database)
- MailChimp

## Installation
You can simply clone this repository, and run "npm install" to install dependencies, then use "npm start" to start the application.

## Usage
This is a small webshop, you can find information on the main page, also can subscribe to newsletter and send a message. You can shop some honey, drop them in the cart, review them, edit them, checkout, etc.
